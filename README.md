# Computer Vision - Rock, Paper, Scissors
Rock, paper, scissors using Teachable Machine to collect images to create a model that recognises hand gestures.

## Creating the Model
- First step was to create the image model using Teachable Machine. Using the built in webcam, recording specific hand gestures directly to the website, between 300 - 450 images, infront of a plain backgroud and without my face in the same frame. 
- Creating four different classes for the three specific hand gestures associated with the game and allowing those images to train the machine. This took a couple of minutes. 
- Once the machine has been trained, the model is ready to be previewed and downloaded.
